# WinForms-Text-Extractor
C# application based on the Tesseract-OCR that extracted keywords from the architectural design files , that could be used for a more efficient search in the database.

This project was built during my Internship in EYDAP in 2020 in Database Mangement.

I built this tool to help my co-workers and myself included to organise the database in more efficient way by adding search key-words in each data entry.

The application Implements the Tesseract-OCR

It is multilingual since i've added the option to download any language file you want inside the app.

The output of the application can either be a JSON or an Excel File.
